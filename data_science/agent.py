"""Top level agent for data agent multi-agents.

This module defines the main orchestrator agent for the insurance risk analytics
multi-agent system. It coordinates between different specialized agents to provide
comprehensive insurance data analysis, risk assessment, and predictive modeling.

The agent follows a workflow where it:
1. Gets data from database (e.g., BigQuery) using NL2SQL
2. Uses NL2Py to perform further data analysis as needed
3. Coordinates with specialized sub-agents for specific tasks

Key Components:
- Root agent orchestrator with multi-agent architecture
- Database integration via BigQuery
- Risk assessment and analytics capabilities
- Machine learning model integration
- SHAP-based explainability features

Dependencies:
- Google ADK for agent framework
- BigQuery for data storage and querying
- Various sub-agents for specialized tasks
